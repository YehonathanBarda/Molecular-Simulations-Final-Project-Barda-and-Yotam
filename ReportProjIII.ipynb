    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The standart Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations that we have conducted up until now, fail to capture quantum effetcs that are wished to be described in certain simulated systems. Moreover, complex quantum systems cannot be solved analytically and are very hard to be directly simulated since it involves solving numerically a highly complex partial differential equation which holds many degrees of freedom.\n",

    "Althought PIMD provides a gateway for conducting quantum simulations using classic MD, it holds several limitations:\n",
